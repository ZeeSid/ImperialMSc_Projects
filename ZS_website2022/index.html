						<h3>Lay summary</h3>
					<p>Inflammation is commonly caused by injury or infection. Low-grade, chronic inflammation can persist for years and contribute to a variety of complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, yet its causes are largely unknown. This work intended to provide a greater understanding of the common genetic basis for traits associated with chronic inflammation. It used data from genome-wide association studies, which can identify genetic variants linked to certain phenotypes within a sample population. Data from molecular traits which were originally measured in blood samples were analysed to identify genome-wide genetic correlations and locate any genetic variants associated with more than one phenotype. These traits were interleukin-6, low-density lipoprotein, insulin, fibrinogen, monocytes, vitamin D and triglycerides. The aim of this work was to reveal which traits jointly contribute to chronic inflammation via the same biochemical pathways; it was found that insulin and vitamin D were the most positively correlated, whereas triglycerides and fibrinogen had the largest negative correlation. Analysis of specific genetic variants found that 16 had common effects across at least two of the traits, and five of these were linked to genes involved in the condition retinitis pigmentosa (RP), which causes loss of vision. These findings direct attention to the interaction of particular traits in causing complex disease and add weight to the hypothesis that <span class="tooltip">RP<span class="tooltiptext">retinitis pigmentosa</span></span> is linked to chronic inflammation.</p>

						<p>Systemic, persistent inflammation, known as chronic inflammation, is thought to contribute to a variety of complex diseases. Many genetic loci with small effects on pro- and anti-inflammatory traits may be responsible, although the exact mechanisms of chronic inflammation are not known. This work highlights specific molecular traits that are involved in this process, using previously published summary data from genome-wide association studies on pro-inflammatory interleukin-6, low-density lipoprotein, insulin, fibrinogen, monocytes and triglycerides as well as anti-inflammatory vitamin D. Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to establish genetic correlations between all pairs of traits at a genome-wide level, implying the presence of pleiotropic loci. Insulin and vitamin D showed the strongest positive correlation with r<sub>g</sub>= 0.54, and the largest negative correlation was between triglycerides and fibrinogen (r<sub>g</sub>= -0.21). Furthermore, in two-tailed meta-analysis using ASSET and the Bayesian-based method Metasoft, 16 pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, nine of which had not been previously associated with at least one trait (p < 5 x 10<sup>-8</sup>). The functional annotation tool FUMA found that five of the <span class="tooltip">SNPs<span class="tooltiptext">Single Nucleotide Polymorphism</span></span> lie within or near genomic regions linked to retinitis pigmentosa, for which there is conflicting research regarding the role of chronic inflammation in disease progression. This work has pointed to the need for a comprehensive meta-analysis of a larger number of inflammatory molecular traits in order to uncover more pleiotropic loci. This could enhance understanding of complex diseases and potentially lead to innovation in their treatment, particularly of retinitis pigmentosa, which currently has no cure.</p>
